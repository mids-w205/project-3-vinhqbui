# Code

1. Centrality.ipynb:
  - The coding exercise in this project must be run first to create stations and relationship between stations. 
  - After that, the project notebook can be run in order from the beginning.
  - There are 2 algorithms in this file: **Degree Centrality** and **betweeness**
2. Dijiktra.ipynb:
  - Can be run from top to bottom. 
  - Using **Dijiktra** to find shortest path

In conclusion, we have 3 algorithms in the coding.
